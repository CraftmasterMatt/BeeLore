--- GENERAL LIST OF FACTIONS ---

This list encompasses general information about the various factions of Beestation's Lore.
If a faction is added to the lore, make sure to add them to the list.

--- NANOTRASEN ---

An intergalactic megacorporation with vast reach and deep pockets.
Their current focus is in regards to a strange material known as 'Plasma' that can only be found on the planet 'Lavaland'.
To further their research, they have built two space stations in orbit of Planet Lavaland.
These stations are codenamed 'GOLDEN' and 'SAGE'.
Due to their influence, there are many that would wish them harm.


--- THE SYNDICATE ---

Intel on the organization that refers to themselveas as 'The Syndicate' is sparse and often conflicting.
Some intelligence claims that they are a privatized union, others claim that they are a separate, rival megacorporation.

The only confirmed intel is this; they have sleeper agents that have infiltrated Nanotrasen in nearly every department,
awaiting their orders. Such commands may be something as simple as stealing documents or objects, while other objectives may include assassintation of personnel.
They also have dedicated Nuclear Operatives, heavily armed and with a single-minded dedication to obtaining one of Nanotrasen's nuclear authentication disks
in order to detonate a nuclear bomb aboard the station, and they are willing to ruthlessly and brutally cleave a path through anyone and anything that gets in their way.

One thing is clear; they are the sworn enemies of Nanotrasen, and they are dedicating every resource at their disposal toward its destruction.


--- CHANGELINGS ---

Changelings are an alien race known for their incredible stealth and lethality.
Utilizing their ability to copy genetic information and become a spitting image of whomever they have copied, they are often used as infiltrators
by the Syndicate; but other factions may make use of them as well, and some changelings may oppose Nanotrasen for reasons of their own.

Their unique anatomy and their incredible regenerative abilities makes them a force to be reckoned with; the mere mention
of Changelings or 'lings' is enough to sow panic and mistrust among the crew.


--- THE WIZARD FEDERATION ---

The ancient art of magic, thought long ago to be nothing more than fantasy, has proven itself to be real in a very, very potent way.
The Wizard Fedaration is a group of magi dedicated to the preservation and usage of magic.
They are currently neutral, but infrequently bother Nanotrasen's space stations for some reason or another.
